This is a new project that improves on my previous crypto trading project (incomplete) while using next.JS instead. 

## Getting Started

npm run dev... That's it. Cron jobs aren't configured but manually ran to compile more coins until I decide to move to a server. 
node cron.js to fetch 100 coins. 
 
## More to be added later
